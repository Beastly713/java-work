========================
Java Core Concepts
========================

1. Class, Object, Instance

Class
- A class is a user-defined data type.
- It acts as a blueprint for creating objects.
- It defines:
  - State → fields (variables)
  - Behavior → methods (functions)

Data Type
- A data type defines the kind of value a variable can hold.
- It tells the compiler:
  - How to interpret the data
  - How much memory to allocate
  - What operations are allowed

Object
- An object is a concrete runtime instance of a class.
- It contains:
  - Allocated memory
  - Actual values in its fields
  - Access to the class’s methods

Instance
- A specific object created from a class.
- A specific occurrence of a defined type in memory.
- An allocated structure with real values.

Relationship:
Class → Blueprint
Object → Built structure
Instance → The actual built structure in memory

--------------------------------------------------

2. Access Modifiers

Definition:
- An access modifier controls visibility and accessibility of:
  - Classes
  - Methods
  - Variables

Common access levels:
- public → accessible everywhere
- private → accessible only within the same class
- default (no modifier) → accessible within the same package
- protected → accessible within package + subclasses

Access modifiers enforce encapsulation and control interaction.

--------------------------------------------------

3. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)

Definition:
- The JVM is the runtime environment that executes Java bytecode.
- It provides platform independence.

Execution process:
You write code → .java file
Compiler (javac) converts → bytecode (.class file)
JVM runs the bytecode

Key idea:
- Java is compiled once.
- Bytecode runs anywhere a JVM exists.

--------------------------------------------------

4. Package

Definition:
- A package is a namespace that groups related classes.
- It organizes code and prevents naming conflicts.

Key rule:
- Package name must match folder structure after source root.

Purpose:
- Organization
- Modularity
- Access control

--------------------------------------------------

5. main Method and Program Entry

a. Entry Point
- main is the entry point of a Java application.
- The JVM starts execution from this method.
- Without main, a class cannot run directly as a standalone program.

--------------------------------------------------

b. Compilation vs Execution

- Compilation does NOT depend on main.
- Running directly DOES depend on main.

Classes without main:
- Are compiled normally.
- Can be used by other classes.
- Are definitions/tools, not standalone programs.

--------------------------------------------------

c. Why main Must Be public

- The JVM is outside your class.
- It must access and invoke main.
- If main is not public → JVM refuses to invoke it.

Important distinction:
- public is NOT for the compiler.
- The compiler sees everything during compilation.
- public is an access-control rule enforced at runtime.

--------------------------------------------------

d. JVM Behavior at Runtime

JVM:
1. Loads the class.
2. Searches for this exact method signature:

public static void main(String[] args)

If:
- Method exists AND is public → runs.
- Method exists but not public → refuses to invoke.

This is a runtime entry-point rule.

--------------------------------------------------

e. Does File Name Have to Be main.java?

NO.

- main is a method.
- File name must match the public class name, not the main method.

Example:
public class MyApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {}
}

File name must be:
MyApp.java

--------------------------------------------------

f. Public Class Rule

A .java file can contain:
- 0 public classes
- OR 1 public class
- Never more than one

If a file contains a public class:
- The file name MUST match that public class.

--------------------------------------------------

g. Why Java Enforces "One Public Class Per File"

Reason: Compiler efficiency and deterministic lookup.

Compiler behavior:
- When compiling ClassA.java and encountering:
  PublicClassB obj = new PublicClassB();

- Compiler must locate PublicClassB.

If filename = public class name:
- Compiler directly checks:
  PublicClassB.java or PublicClassB.class
- O(1) lookup.

If no rule existed:
- Compiler would need to scan all files.
- Compilation would be slow in large projects.

Therefore:
Filename = public class name
→ Guarantees fast lookup.

--------------------------------------------------

h. Why Non-Public Classes Don’t Require Matching Filename

- Non-public (package-private) classes:
  - Accessible only within the same package.
- Compiler only searches within that directory.
- No global lookup required.

Therefore:
- Multiple non-public classes can exist in one file.

--------------------------------------------------

6. main Method Structure

public static void main(String[] args) {
    // execution starts here
}

Components:
- public → JVM must access it
- static → no object required
- void → returns nothing
- main → required method name
- String[] args → receives command-line arguments

Signature must match exactly.

--------------------------------------------------

7. Variables

Definition:
- A variable is a symbolic name associated with a memory location.
- Its value may change during execution.

--------------------------------------------------

8. Data Types

Primitive types:
- int
- double
- boolean
- char
- etc.

Primitive types:
- Store actual values directly.
- Have fixed memory size.

--------------------------------------------------

9. String

Definition:
- A String is a finite, ordered sequence of characters.
- Represented using a character encoding.
- Treated as a single object in Java.

Rules:
- Capital S → String
- Use double quotes:
  "Hello"

Example:
String name = "Alice";

--------------------------------------------------

10. Control Flow

Definition:
- Control flow determines the order of execution.

Includes:
- if / else
- switch
- loops (for, while, do-while)
- break / continue

Conceptually similar to C++.

--------------------------------------------------

11. Core Mental Model Summary

- Class = Blueprint
- Object = Runtime instance
- Package = Namespace
- Source root = Where packages begin
- public class → filename must match
- JVM runs bytecode, not source
- main is required only for direct execution
- Compilation and runtime are separate phases
